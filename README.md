# connect-4 

Welcome to connect-4, a classic strategy game where two players compete to connect four of their colored discs in a row, column, or diagonal. This repository contains the code for a digital implementation of the Connect 4 game.

## Game Rules and Description

Connect 4 is played on a 6x7 grid. Players take turns dropping their colored discs from the top of any column. The disc will then occupy the lowest available spot in that column. The game continues until a player successfully connects four discs either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to achieve this wins the game. The game can start over if desired.
